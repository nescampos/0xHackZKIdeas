# HGT (Hermez Governance Token)

## Introduction

HGT, a governance token (in parallel to the HEZ token) as a reward for the creation of blocks within the Hermez Network, would be an incentive for the use of the network.

## Motivation

Like other networks (such as Theta or VeThor), the main token is decoupled from a token that helps the government and control of the network. In this case, HGT will be the token that the node that generates the next block can receive, in proportion to the HEZ tokens that it is willing to donate as the generator and the number of transactions contained in the block.
That will also help make the proof of donation stronger.

## Value

The value will obviously be variable, like HEZ, but it should be a proportion of the HEZ token, for example at a maximum of 10%, because this ensures that HEZ is the value token and that it must be the one to be used both in transactions as smart contracts.

## How will it work?

1. The operation of Hermez network will not be alternated, it is maintained until now, until the process of the proof of donation for the creation of new blocks.
2. Then, the HGT amount will be automatically calculated according to the following variables: Amount in the donation test (40% weighting), number of transactions (30%), speed of execution of the block (20%) and gas consumed ( 10%).
3. The block is generated, validated and ready on the Ethereum chain.
4. Finally, the HGT amount is sent to the creator of the block.

* The HGT token amounts could be exchanged for HEZ token to be used at the account owner's discretion, or they can be used as part of the proof of donation to continue participating in the network and obtain more reward.


## Other use

1. It can also be used for Staking ERC-20 tokens (when Ethereum changes to Proof of Stake), incentivizing this process to happen from Hermez.
2. In recognition of the creators of the transactions and those who execute the smart contracts, as an incentive (as well as the creators of the blocks) for the use of Hermez network as layer 2 of the process.
