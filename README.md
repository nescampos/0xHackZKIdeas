# HGT (Hermez Governance Token)

## Introduction

HGT, a governance token (in parallel to the HEZ token) as a reward for the creation of blocks within the Hermez Network, would be an incentive for the use of the network.

## Motivation

Like other networks (such as Theta or VeThor), the main token is decoupled from a token that helps the government and control of the network. In this case, HGT will be the token that the node that generates the next block can receive, in proportion to the HEZ tokens that it is willing to donate as the generator and the number of transactions contained in the block.
That will also help make the proof of donation stronger.

## Value

The value will obviously be variable, like HEZ, but it should be a proportion of the HEZ token, for example at a maximum of 10%, because this ensures that HEZ is the value token and that it must be the one to be used both in transactions as smart contracts.
